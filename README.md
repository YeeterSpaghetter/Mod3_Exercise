The purpose of this repository is to help teach me how to set up repositories
in github, as well as file uploading from web. It can be used in the future to see if I need to double check
certain aspects of repository creation, or file uploading. I love using git to link my 
group projects with GitHub 

I still love using Git to link my project in GitHub
